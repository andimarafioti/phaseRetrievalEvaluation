# [Time-Frequency Phase Retrieval for Audio --- The Effect of Transform Parameters]()


In audio processing applications, phase retrieval (PR) is often performed from short-time Fourier transform (STFT) coefficients. Although PR performance has been observed to depend on the considered STFT parameters and audio data, the extent of this dependence has not been systematically evaluated yet. To address this, we studied the performance of three PR algorithms for various types of audio content and various STFT parameters such as redundancy, time-frequency ratio, and type of the window. The quality of PR was studied in terms of auditory-based and signal-based measures, namely objective difference grade, and signal-to-noise ratio of the STFT magnitude. Our results show that PR quality improved with increasing redundancy, with a strong relevance of the time-frequency ratio. The effect of the audio content was smaller but still observable. Interestingly, for optimal PR quality, each of the three algorithms required a different set of parameters, demonstrating the relevance of individual parameter sets for a fair comparison across PR algorithms. Based on these results, we developed a tool for finding optimal STFT parameters, considering arbitrary PR algorithms and types of audio content.
